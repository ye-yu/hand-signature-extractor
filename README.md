# hand-signature-extractor
To produce a PNG with transparency of the hand signature

## Dependency
There are a few dependencies required to use this project. I may produce an executable release with dependency included, but that is a long-term development.

- opencv-python: use `conda install -c conda-forge opencv-python` to install
- numpy: (will be included with installation of opencv-python through conda)
